                    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
                    <p>Ridge collects two types of information:</p>

                    <h3>Location Data</h3>
                    <p>Collected only while actively using navigation features.</p>
                    <p>Processed locally on your device and <strong>not stored or transmitted</strong> by the developer.</p>

                    <h3>Anonymous Analytics (Firebase Analytics / Google Analytics 4)</h3>
                    <p>Ridge uses Firebase Analytics (Google Analytics 4) to collect anonymous usage and performance data, such as:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Feature usage</li>
                        <li>App interaction patterns</li>
                        <li>Session duration</li>
                        <li>Device type and OS version</li>
                        <li>Device ID</li>
                        <li>Crash and stability information</li>

                    </ul>

                    <h4>IP-Address Handling (Google Analytics 4)</h4>
                    <p>Google Analytics 4 does not log or store full IP addresses by employing masking. For users located in the EU, IP data is processed solely to generate approximate location information (such as city and country) on servers within the EU. The IP address is then immediately discarded before any data is sent to other Analytics processing servers, which may be located outside the EU, including in the United States. At no point are full IP addresses retained, stored, or accessible to the developer.</p>
                    <p>No direct personal identifiers, such as name, email address, or phone number, are stored or accessible to the developer.</p>

                    <p>Ridge includes information about ski resorts located in EU countries; however, we do not target or identify individual users in the EU, do not collect personal data, and only process limited, low-risk information such as anonymous usage analytics. Based on the nature, scope, context, and low volume of this processing, we currently consider that we meet the exemption criteria under Article 27 of the EU GDPR and are not required to appoint an EU representative.</p>
                    <p>We will continue to monitor our processing activities and user base, and we will appoint an EU representative if our circumstances change in a way that makes this necessary.</p>
