Last updated: 04/12/2025

## 1. Agreement to Terms
Ridge Maps (referred to herein as "Ridge" or the "App") offers a mobile application ("Ridge"). By accepting these Terms & Conditions, you agree that you use Ridge contingently with the terms set forth herein.

---

## 2. Description of Ridge
Ridge provides recreational ski navigation, run selection, lift guidance, and route planning based on publicly available and proprietary map data.  
The App does not provide real-time snow conditions, weather information, or safety-certified navigation.

---

## 3. Not a Safety-Certified Navigation System
Ridge is not a replacement for official resort signage, certified navigation equipment, or avalanche guidance.  
Local ski conditions, closures, hazards, and posted signs always take precedence over any route provided within the App.

---

## 4. User Responsibilities
Users agree to:
- Follow all resort rules and signage
- Prioritise local signage over Ridge 
- Maintain awareness of surroundings  
- Ski within their abilities  
- Not rely solely on Ridge for safety-critical decisions 

Ridge Maps accepts no responsibility for negligent behaviour resulting from failure to observe the above points.

---

## 5. Location Data
Ridge may request access to the device location to improve route accuracy.  
Location data is processed on the device and is not transmitted or stored by the developer.

---

## 6. No Account Required
Ridge does not require account creation and does not collect personal identifying information.

---

## 7. Data Collection & Privacy
Ridge does not collect direct personal identifiers, such as your name, email address, or phone number. We may collect anonymous usage data and device identifiers for the sole purpose of analytics and improving the app.
Anonymous crash logs or diagnostics may be collected by Apple and our third-party services to improve app stability and performance.
See the Ridge Privacy Policy for more details on the limited data we collect.

---

## 8. Third-Party Data & Accuracy
Ridge uses map and ski-area data from third-party or community sources.
The developer does not guarantee that any information displayed in the App, including but not limited to maps, trail status, lift operations, or estimated skiing durations, is accurate, complete, or up-to-date.
All such information, including time estimates, is provided for general guidance only and may vary due to user skill level, conditions, operational changes, or data inaccuracies.
Accordingly, the developer cannot be held liable for any errors, omissions, delays, or inaccuracies in the displayed information, nor for any consequences arising from reliance on it.

---

## 9. Limitation of Liability
To the maximum extent permitted by law, the developer is not liable for any injury, accident, or loss arising from use of Ridge, including but not limited to:
- Skiing accidents  
- Incorrect navigation  
- Reliance on map, trail, lift, or duration data
- Device issues while skiing  

Use of Ridge is entirely at your own risk.

---

## 10. Changes to Ridge
The App's content, features, or functionality may change at any time without notice.

---

## 11. Updates to Terms
These Terms may be updated periodically.

# Ridge – Privacy Policy

Last updated: 04/12/2025

## 1. Information We Collect
Ridge collects two types of information:

### **Location Data**
Collected only while actively using navigation features.  
Processed locally on your device and **not stored or transmitted** by the developer.

### **Anonymous Analytics (Firebase Analytics / Google Analytics 4)**
Ridge uses Firebase Analytics (Google Analytics 4) to collect anonymous usage and performance data, such as:
- Feature usage
- App interaction patterns
- Session duration
- Device type and OS version
- Device ID
- Crash and stability information
- Approximate user location (city and country) derived from the user's IP address

#### IP-Address Handling (Google Analytics 4)
Google Analytics 4 does not log or store full IP addresses by employing masking. For users located in the EU, IP data is processed solely to generate approximate location information (such as city and country) on servers within the EU. The IP address is then immediately discarded before any data is sent to other Analytics processing servers, which may be located outside the EU, including in the United States. At no point are full IP addresses retained, stored, or accessible to the developer.

No direct personal identifiers, such as name, email address, or phone number, are stored or accessible to the developer.

---

## 2. Children’s Data
Ridge is not intended for children under 16.
We do not knowingly collect or process personal data from children. If you believe a child has provided data, please contact us so we can delete it.

---

## 3. How We Use Your Information
We use:
- **Location data** to provide navigation, route planning, and map positioning in line with GDPR Art. 6(1)(b)
- **Anonymous analytics** to understand how the app is used and improve stability, usability, and performance in line with GDPR Art. 6(1)(a)

We do not use your data for advertising or tracking across apps.

---

## 4. Data Storage
- Resort map data and user preferences are stored **locally on your device**  
- Location data is processed in real-time and immediately discarded after use
- Crash logs collected by Apple are stored according to Apple’s retention policies; see Apple’s privacy documentation for details 
- Firebase stores **anonymous analytics** on secure Google servers  
- Ridge does **not** operate external servers and does **not** store personal user data  

---

## 5. Third-Party Services
Ridge uses:

### **Firebase Analytics (Google)**
Used solely for anonymous usage statistics and performance insights.  
Firebase may collect:
- Device model
- Device ID  
- OS version  
- App version  
- Interaction patterns  
- Crash/diagnostic information
- Coarse geo-location derived from IP address (the full IP address is not logged or stored)

Firebase does **not** receive direct identifiers such as name, email, or phone number, which would directly reveal your identity.

Firebase Analytics acts as a data processor on our behalf. Processing is governed by Google’s Data Processing Agreement and the use of EU Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) to safeguard international data transfers outside the UK or EU. Google may process data on servers located outside the UK or EU (including the United States). These transfers rely on GDPR-approved safeguards.

---

## 6. EU Representative (Article 27 GDPR)
Ridge includes information about ski resorts located in EU countries; however, we do not target or identify individual users in the EU, do not collect personal data, and only process limited, low-risk information such as anonymous usage analytics. Based on the nature, scope, context, and low volume of this processing, we currently consider that we meet the exemption criteria under Article 27 of the EU GDPR and are not required to appoint an EU representative.

We will continue to monitor our processing activities and user base, and we will appoint an EU representative if our circumstances change in a way that makes this necessary.

---

## 7. Your Rights & Controls
You may:
- Disable location access at any time in iOS Settings  
- Disable analytics at the OS level (Settings → Privacy & Security → Analytics & Improvements)  
- Delete the App to remove all locally stored data  

User-level and event-level analytics data will automatically be deleted after 14 months of inactivity or uninstalling the App.

In addition, users in the UK and EU have the following rights under GDPR:
- Right of access to your personal data
- Right to rectification of inaccurate data
- Right to erasure (“right to be forgotten”)
- Right to restrict processing
- Right to object to processing (including analytics based on legitimate interest)
- Right to data portability where applicable
- Right to withdraw consent at any time
- Right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority:
  - UK users: Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO)
  - EU users: Your local Data Protection Authority

Because Ridge does not collect identifiable personal data, these rights may have limited practical applicability, but we will honour all lawful requests.
